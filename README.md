# Heart_Failure_Prediction_Logistic_Regression_Model
This model predicting whether a patient will experience a death event (1) or not (0) based on various features or input variables.

**__General View__**

I sourced the training data for this model from Kaggle and explored on the dataset. I analyzed the correlations among various features and visualized the insights using plots for better observation. Subsequently, I divided the dataset into training and testing groups, constructed a logistic regression model, and trained it using the existing data to collectively predict whether a death event is likely to occur. Finally, I conducted an analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of the model.
